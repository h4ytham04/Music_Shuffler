Hello! I am Haytham, and have made a music player. This is my first time uploading something to github, so excuse me if I have done something wrong. The main file has all the code, and has my file paths in it, so you'll probably have to change it in order for it to work. Can pick any folder of mp3s, however. I don't have any issues, but a bug i run into is having the music on pause and rewinding, causing the same song to play yet another one is highlighted. Anything helps. Again, Thanks for reading!
